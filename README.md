## Dataset
> We will investigate  **Ford GoBike System Dataset**, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it which called data wrangling. 

>**Ford GoBike System Dataset**  includes information about individual rides made
in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

> our dataset orginally consists of 183,412 row (records) and 16 columns and Most variables are numeric and concerns three major things as follow: 
>        
    - Trip (duration_sec, start_time, end_time)
    - station (start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude)
    - User (bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip)

> After adjustment and cleaning process new columns were created to help in analyzing and expolring the data so, our dataset consists of 21 columns now and the new columns as follow:
>
    - Trip (duration_min, start_date, Trip_day of the week, Trip_hour of the day)
    - User (member_age)
